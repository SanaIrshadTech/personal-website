**🌐 Personal Website: Sana Irshad**

This repository contains the HTML and CSS code for my basic personal portfolio website. It serves as a professional introduction, sharing my journey, achievements, and aspirations while maintaining a clean, responsive design. It was developed as part of an assignment for my APAD class in the MSITM program at UT Austin. 


**📜 Overview**

The website is structured to highlight: 

▪ Introduction & Background – My professional journey and purpose for pursuing the MSITM program at UT Austin. 

▪ About Me – Career milestones, leadership roles, and personal achievements. 

▪ Career Journey – A visual timeline of my professional growth. 

▪ What Drives Me – Core values and motivations. 

▪ Vision – Short-term and long-term career goals. 

▪ Professional Links – Direct access to my LinkedIn, Salesforce Trailblazer profile, and GitHub. 


**🛠️ Tech Stack** 

▪ HTML5 – For semantic and accessible structure. 

▪ CSS – For styling, layout, and responsiveness.
