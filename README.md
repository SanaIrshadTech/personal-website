🌐 **Personal Website: Sana Irshad **

This repository contains the HTML and CSS code for my basic personal portfolio website. It serves as a professional introduction, sharing my journey, achievements, and aspirations while maintaining a clean, responsive design. It was developed as part of an assignment for my APAD class in the MSITM program at UT Austin. 

**📜 Overview **

The website is structured to highlight: 

♦ Introduction & Background – My professional journey and purpose for pursuing the MSITM program at UT Austin. 

♦ About Me – Career milestones, leadership roles, and personal achievements. 

♦ Career Journey – A visual timeline of my professional growth. 

♦ What Drives Me – Core values and motivations. 

♦ Vision – Short-term and long-term career goals. 

♦ Professional Links – Direct access to my LinkedIn, Salesforce Trailblazer profile, and GitHub. 

🛠️ Tech Stack 

♦ HTML5 – For semantic and accessible structure. 

♦ CSS – For styling, layout, and responsiveness.
