    <h1>Hi, I’m Sana Irshad 💻🧕✨</h1>
    <p>With 9+ years of experience in the IT industry, I have built multiple tech-driven solutions for 
      customers and contributed to organizational growth beyond individual projects. Currently, I’m on a mandatory pause to pursue the MSITM program at UT Austin—an intentional step to realign my skills and goals, and position myself more strongly in the fast-paced world of technological innovation.</p>
    <p>This journey is a gift to my younger self, a chance to upskill myself by earning a degree from the world’s leading country in technology and innovation.</p>
    <p>Also as UT says, <b><I>“What starts here changes the world”</I></b>, I am indeed ready to change mine first so that I can contribute to the world.</p>

  <!-- About Me Section -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>💡 About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m a Salesforce-certified expert and woman in tech advocate who enjoys building meaningful solutions. From mentoring aspiring engineers to redesigning large-scale Salesforce solutions, I bring a mix of empathy, clarity, and technical depth.</p>
    <p>I am the first girl in my family to enter a technical field and a first-generation engineer majoring in Computer Science. This accomplishment was shaped by navigating societal expectations and gender biases. 
      These formative experiences have fueled my drive to lead with purpose, and I’ve since taken on leadership roles where I’m known for blending innovation with inclusion.</p>
